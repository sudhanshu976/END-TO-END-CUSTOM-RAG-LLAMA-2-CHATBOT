       " Document(page_content='Chapter 1\\nPreliminaries\\n1.1 Introduction\\n1.1.1 What is Machine Learning?\\nLearning , like intelligence, covers such a broad range of processes that it is dif-\\n\\x0ccult to de\\x0cne precisely. A dictionary de\\x0cnition includes phrases such as \\\\to\\ngain knowledge, or understanding of, or skill in, by study, instruction, or expe-\\nrience,\" and \\\\modi\\x0ccation of a behavioral tendency by experience.\" Zoologists\\nand psychologists study learning in animals and humans. In this book we fo-\\ncus on learning in machines. There are several parallels between animal and\\nmachine learning. Certainly, many techniques in machine learning derive from\\nthe e\\x0borts of psychologists to make more precise their theories of animal and\\nhuman learning through computational models. It seems likely also that the\\nconcepts and techniques being explored by researchers in machine learning may\\nilluminate certain aspects of biological learning.\\nAs regards machines, we might say, very broadly, that a machine learns\\nwhenever it changes its structure, program, or data (based on its inputs or in\\nresponse to external information) in such a manner that its expected future\\nperformance improves. Some of these changes, such as the addition of a record\\nto a data base, fall comfortably within the province of other disciplines and are\\nnot necessarily better understood for being called learning. But, for example,\\nwhen the performance of a speech-recognition machine improves after hearing\\nseveral samples of a person\\'s speech, we feel quite justi\\x0ced in that case to say\\nthat the machine has learned.\\nMachine learning usually refers to the changes in systems that perform tasks\\nassociated with arti\\x0ccial intelligence (AI) . Such tasks involve recognition, diag-\\nnosis, planning, robot control, prediction, etc. The \\\\changes\" might be either\\nenhancements to already performing systems or ab initio synthesis of new sys-\\ntems. To be slightly more speci\\x0cc, we show the architecture of a typical AI\\n1', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

This agent perceives and models its environment and com-\\nputes appropriate actions, perhaps by anticipating their e\\x0bects.

Why not design ma-\\nchines to perform as desired in the \\x0crst place?\" There are several reasons why\\nmachine learning is important. Of course, we have already mentioned that the\\nachievement of learning in machines might help us understand how animals and\\nhumans learn. But there are important engineering reasons as well. Some of\\nthese are:\\n\\x0fSome tasks cannot be de\\x0cned well except by example; that is, we might be\\nable to specify input/output pairs but not a concise relationship between\\ninputs and desired outputs. We would like machines to be able to adjust\\ntheir internal structure to produce correct outputs for a large number of\\nsample inputs and thus suitably constrain their input/output function to\\napproximate the relationship implicit in the examples.\\n\\x0fIt is possible that hidden among large piles of data are important rela-\\ntionships and correlations. Machine learning methods can often be used\\nto extract these relationships ( data mining ).', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1.1. INTRODUCTION 3\\n\\x0fHuman designers often produce machines that do not work as well as\\ndesired in the environments in which they are used. In fact, certain char-\\nacteristics of the working environment might not be completely known\\nat design time. Machine learning methods can be used for on-the-job\\nimprovement of existing machine designs.\\n\\x0fThe amount of knowledge available about certain tasks might be too large\\nfor explicit encoding by humans. Machines that learn this knowledge\\ngradually might be able to capture more of it than humans would want to\\nwrite down.\\n\\x0fEnvironments change over time. Machines that can adapt to a changing\\nenvironment would reduce the need for constant redesign.\\n\\x0fNew knowledge about tasks is constantly being discovered by humans.\\nVocabulary changes. There is a constant stream of new events in the\\nworld. Continuing redesign of AI systems to conform to new knowledge is\\nimpractical, but machine learning methods might be able to track much\\nof it.\\n1.1.2 Wellsprings of Machine Learning\\nWork in machine learning is now converging from several sources. These dif-\\nferent traditions each bring di\\x0berent methods and di\\x0berent vocabulary which\\nare now being assimilated into a more uni\\x0ced discipline. Here is a brief listing\\nof some of the separate disciplines that have contributed to machine learning;\\nmore details will follow in the the appropriate chapters:\\n\\x0fStatistics: A long-standing problem in statistics is how best to use sam-\\nples drawn from unknown probability distributions to help decide from\\nwhich distribution some new sample is drawn. A related problem is how\\nto estimate the value of an unknown function at a new point given the\\nvalues of this function at a set of sample points. Statistical methods\\nfor dealing with these problems can be considered instances of machine\\nlearning because the decision and estimation rules depend on a corpus of\\nsamples drawn from the problem environment. We will explore some of\\nthe statistical methods later in the book. Details about the statistical the-\\nory underlying these methods can be found in statistical textbooks such\\nas [Anderson, 1958].\\n\\x0fBrain Models: Non-linear elements with weighted inputs\\nhave been suggested as simple models of biological neu-\\nrons. Networks of these elements have been studied by sev-\\neral researchers including [McCulloch & Pitts, 1943, Hebb, 1949,\\nRosenblatt, 1958] and, more recently by [Gluck & Rumelhart, 1989,\\nSejnowski, Koch, & Churchland, 1988].

We shall see that several important machine learning\\ntechniques are based on networks of nonlinear elements|often called\\nneural networks . Work inspired by this school is sometimes called\\nconnectionism ,brain-style computation , orsub-symbolic processing .\\n\\x0fAdaptive Control Theory: Control theorists study the problem of con-\\ntrolling a process having unknown parameters which must be estimated\\nduring operation. Often, the parameters change during operation, and the\\ncontrol process must track these changes. Some aspects of controlling a\\nrobot based on sensory inputs represent instances of this sort of problem.\\nFor an introduction see [Bollinger & Du\\x0ee, 1988].\\n\\x0fPsychological Models: Psychologists have studied the performance of\\nhumans in various learning tasks.

LEARNING INPUT-OUTPUT FUNCTIONS 5\\n1.1.3 Varieties of Machine Learning\\nOrthogonal to the question of the historical source of any learning technique is\\nthe more important question of what is to be learned. In this book, we take it\\nthat the thing to be learned is a computational structure of some sort. We will\\nconsider a variety of di\\x0berent computational structures:\\n\\x0fFunctions\\n\\x0fLogic programs and rule sets\\n\\x0fFinite-state machines\\n\\x0fGrammars\\n\\x0fProblem solving systems\\nWe will present methods both for the synthesis of these structures from examples\\nand for changing existing structures. In the latter case, the change to the\\nexisting structure might be simply to make it more computationally e\\x0ecient\\nrather than to increase the coverage of the situations it can handle. Much of\\nthe terminology that we shall be using throughout the book is best introduced\\nby discussing the problem of learning functions, and we turn to that matter\\n\\x0crst.\\n1.2 Learning Input-Output Functions\\nWe use Fig. 1.2 to help de\\x0cne some of the terminology used in describing the\\nproblem of learning a function. Imagine that there is a function, f, and the task\\nof the learner is to guess what it is. Our hypothesis about the function to be\\nlearned is denoted by h. Bothfandhare functions of a vector-valued input\\nX= (x1;x2;:::;xi;:::;xn) which has ncomponents. We think of has being\\nimplemented by a device that has Xas input and h(X) as output. Both fand\\nhthemselves may be vector-valued. We assume a priori that the hypothesized\\nfunction,h, is selected from a class of functions H. Sometimes we know that\\nfalso belongs to this class or to a subset of this class. We select hbased on a\\ntraining set , \\x04, ofminput vector examples. Many important details depend on\\nthe nature of the assumptions made about all of these entities.\\n1.2.1 Types of Learning\\nThere are two major settings in which we wish to learn a function. In one,\\ncalled supervised learning , we know (sometimes only approximately) the values\\nofffor themsamples in the training set, \\x04. We assume that if we can \\x0cnd\\na hypothesis, h, that closely agrees with ffor the members of \\x04, then this\\nhypothesis will be a good guess for f|especially if \\x04 is large.', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

Sup-\\npose we are given the values of a two-dimensional function, f, at the four sample\\npoints shown by the solid circles in Fig. 1.3. We want to \\x0ct these four points\\nwith a function, h, drawn from the set, H, of second-degree functions. We show\\nthere a two-dimensional parabolic surface above the x1,x2plane that \\x0cts the\\npoints. This parabolic function, h, is our hypothesis about the function, f, that\\nproduced the four samples. In this case, h=fat the four samples, but we need\\nnot have required exact matches.\\nIn the other setting, termed unsupervised learning , we simply have a train-\\ning set of vectors without function values for them. The problem in this case,\\ntypically, is to partition the training set into subsets, \\x04 1, . . . , \\x04R, in some ap-\\npropriate way. (We can still regard the problem as one of learning a function;\\nthe value of the function is the name of the subset to which an input vector be-\\nlongs.) Unsupervised learning methods have application in taxonomic problems\\nin which it is desired to invent ways to classify data into meaningful categories.\\nWe shall also describe methods that are intermediate between supervised\\nand unsupervised learning.\\nWe might either be trying to \\x0cnd a new function, h, or to modify an existing\\none. An interesting special case is that of changing an existing function into an\\nequivalent one that is computationally more e\\x0ecient. This type of learning is\\nsometimes called speed-up learning. A very simple example of speed-up learning\\ninvolves deduction processes. From the formulas A\\x1bBandB\\x1bC, we can\\ndeduceCif we are given A.

But with this new formula we can derive Cmore quickly, given A, than\\nwe could have done before. We can contrast speed-up learning with methods\\nthat create genuinely new functions|ones that might give di\\x0berent results after\\nlearning than they did before. We say that the latter methods involve inductive\\nlearning. As opposed to deduction, there are no correct inductions|only useful\\nones.\\n1.2.2 Input Vectors\\nBecause machine learning methods derive from so many di\\x0berent traditions, its\\nterminology is rife with synonyms, and we will be using most of them in this\\nbook. For example, the input vector is called by a variety of names. Some\\nof these are: input vector ,pattern vector ,feature vector ,sample ,example , and\\ninstance . The components, xi, of the input vector are variously called features ,\\nattributes ,input variables , and components .\\nThe values of the components can be of three main types. They might\\nbe real-valued numbers, discrete-valued numbers, or categorical values . As an\\nexample illustrating categorical values, information about a student might be\\nrepresented by the values of the attributes class, major, sex, adviser . A par-\\nticular student would then be represented by a vector such as: (sophomore,\\nhistory, male, higgins). Additionally, categorical values may be ordered (as in\\nfsmall, medium, large g) orunordered (as in the example just given). Of course,\\nmixtures of all these types of values are possible.\\nIn all cases, it is possible to represent the input in unordered form by listing\\nthe names of the attributes together with their values. The vector form assumes\\nthat the attributes are ordered and given implicitly by a form. As an example\\nof an attribute-value representation, we might have: (major: history, sex: male,', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

We will be using the vector form\\nexclusively.\\nAn important specialization uses Boolean values, which can be regarded as\\na special case of either discrete numbers (1,0) or of categorical variables ( True,\\nFalse ).\\n1.2.3 Outputs\\nThe output may be a real number, in which case the process embodying the\\nfunction,h, is called a function estimator , and the output is called an output\\nvalue orestimate .\\nAlternatively, the output may be a categorical value, in which case the pro-\\ncess embodying his variously called a classi\\x0cer , arecognizer , or a categorizer ,\\nand the output itself is called a label, aclass, acategory , or a decision . Classi-\\n\\x0cers have application in a number of recognition problems, for example in the\\nrecognition of hand-printed characters. The input in that case is some suitable\\nrepresentation of the printed character, and the classi\\x0cer maps this input into\\none of, say, 64 categories.\\nVector-valued outputs are also possible with components being real numbers\\nor categorical values.\\nAn important special case is that of Boolean output values. In that case,\\na training pattern having value 1 is called a positive instance , and a training\\nsample having value 0 is called a negative instance . When the input is also\\nBoolean, the classi\\x0cer implements a Boolean function . We study the Boolean\\ncase in some detail because it allows us to make important general points in\\na simpli\\x0ced setting. Learning a Boolean function is sometimes called concept\\nlearning , and the function is called a concept .\\n1.2.4 Training Regimes\\nThere are several ways in which the training set, \\x04, can be used to produce a\\nhypothesized function. In the batch method, the entire training set is available\\nand used all at once to compute the function, h. A variation of this method\\nuses the entire training set to modify a current hypothesis iteratively until an\\nacceptable hypothesis is obtained. By contrast, in the incremental method, we\\nselect one member at a time from the training set and use this instance alone\\nto modify a current hypothesis. Then another member of the training set is\\nselected, and so on. The selection method can be random (with replacement)\\nor it can cycle through the training set iteratively. If the entire training set\\nbecomes available one member at a time, then we might also use an incremental\\nmethod|selecting and using training set members as they arrive. (Alterna-\\ntively, at any stage all training set members so far available could be used in a\\n\\\\batch\" process.) Using the training set members as they become available is\\ncalled an online method. Online methods might be used, for example, when the', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

The next set of sensory inputs\\nwill depend on which action was selected.\\n1.2.5 Noise\\nSometimes the vectors in the training set are corrupted by noise. There are two\\nkinds of noise. Class noise randomly alters the value of the function; attribute\\nnoise randomly alters the values of the components of the input vector. In either\\ncase, it would be inappropriate to insist that the hypothesized function agree\\nprecisely with the values of the samples in the training set.\\n1.2.6 Performance Evaluation\\nEven though there is no correct answer in inductive learning, it is important\\nto have methods to evaluate the result of learning. We will discuss this matter\\nin more detail later, but, brie\\ry, in supervised learning the induced function is\\nusually evaluated on a separate set of inputs and function values for them called\\nthetesting set . A hypothesized function is said to generalize when it guesses\\nwell on the testing set. Both mean-squared-error and the total number of errors\\nare common measures.\\n1.3 Learning Requires Bias\\nLong before now the reader has undoubtedly asked why is learning a function\\npossible at all? Certainly, for example, there are an uncountable number of\\ndi\\x0berent functions having values that agree with the four samples shown in Fig.\\n1.3. Why would a learning procedure happen to select the quadratic one shown\\nin that \\x0cgure? In order to make that selection we had at least to limit a priori\\nthe set of hypotheses to quadratic functions and then to insist that the one we\\nchose passed through all four sample points. This kind of a priori information\\nis called bias, and useful learning without bias is impossible.\\nWe can gain more insight into the role of bias by considering the special case\\nof learning a Boolean function of ndimensions. There are 2ndi\\x0berent Boolean\\ninputs possible. Suppose we had no bias; that is His the set of all22nBoolean\\nfunctions, and we have no preference among those that \\x0ct the samples in the\\ntraining set. In this case, after being presented with one member of the training\\nset and its value we can rule out precisely one-half of the members of H|those\\nBoolean functions that would misclassify this labeled sample. The remaining\\nfunctions constitute what is called a \\\\version space;\" we\\'ll explore that concept\\nin more detail later.

Some examples in DNF are: f=x1x2+x2x3x4\\nandf=x1x3+x2x3+x1x2x3. A DNF expression is called a k-term DNF\\nexpression if it is a disjunction of kterms; it is in the class k-DNF if the size of\\nits largest term is k. The examples above are 2-term and 3-term expressions,\\nrespectively. Both expressions are in the class 3-DNF.\\nEach term in a DNF expression for a function is called an implicant because\\nit \\\\implies\" the function (if the term has value 1, so does the function). In\\ngeneral, a term, t, is an implicant of a function, f, iffhas value 1 whenever\\ntdoes. A term, t, is a prime implicant offif the term, t0, formed by taking\\nany literal out of an implicant tis no longer an implicant of f.

Consider,\\nfor example, the function f=x2x3+x1x3+x2x1x3. We illustrate it in Fig.\\n2.3.

These\\nplanes are pictorial devices used to isolate certain lower dimensional subfaces\\nof the cube. Two of them isolate one-dimensional edges , and the third isolates\\na zero-dimensional vertex . Each group of vertices on a subface corresponds to\\none of the implicants of the function, f, and thus each implicant corresponds\\nto a subface of some dimension. A k-dimensional subface corresponds to an\\n(n\\x00k)-size implicant term. The function is written as the disjunction of the\\nimplicants|corresponding to the union of all the vertices cut o\\x0b by all of the\\nplanes.

A k-voting function has value 1 if and only\\nifkor more of its ninputs has value 1.

The k-voting functions are all members of the class of linearly\\nseparable functions in which the weights all have unit value and the threshold\\ndepends on k. Thus, terms and clauses are special cases of linearly separable\\nfunctions.\\nA convenient way to write linearly separable functions uses vector notation:\\nf= thresh( X\\x01W;\\x12)\\nwhere X= (x1;:::;xn) is ann-dimensional vector of input variables, W=\\n(w1;:::;wn) is ann-dimensional vector of weight values, and X\\x01Wis the dot\\n(orinner ) product of the two vectors.

These ideas are most clearly explained for the case\\nof Boolean function learning. Given an initial hypothesis set H(a subset of\\nall Boolean functions) and the values of f(X) for each Xin a training set, \\x04,\\nthe version space is that subset of hypotheses, Hv, that is consistent with these\\nvalues. A hypothesis, h, isconsistent with the values of Xin \\x04 if and only if\\nh(X) =f(X) for all Xin \\x04. We say that the hypotheses in Hthat are not\\nconsistent with the values in the training set are ruled out by the training set.\\nWe could imagine (conceptually only!) that we have devices for implement-\\ning every function in H. An incremental training procedure could then be\\nde\\x0cned which presented each pattern in \\x04 to each of these functions and then\\neliminated those functions whose values for that pattern did not agree with its\\ngiven value. At any stage of the process we would then have left some subset\\nof functions that are consistent with the patterns presented so far; this subset\\nis the version space for the patterns already presented. This idea is illustrated\\nin Fig. 3.1.\\nConsider the following procedure for classifying an arbitrary input pattern,\\nX: the pattern is put in the same class (0 or 1) as are the majority of the\\noutputs of the functions in the version space. During the learning procedure,\\nif this majority is not equal to the value of the pattern presented, we say a\\nmistake is made, and we revise the version space accordingly|eliminating all\\nthose (majority of the) functions voting incorrectly. Thus, whenever a mistake\\nis made, we rule out at least half of the functions remaining in the version space.\\nHow many mistakes can such a procedure make?

In this chapter we describe how networks of non-linear elements\\ncan be used to implement various input-output functions and how they can be\\ntrained using supervised learning methods.\\nNetworks of non-linear elements, interconnected through adjustable weights,\\nplay a prominent role in machine learning. They are called neural networks be-\\ncause the non-linear elements have as their inputs a weighted sum of the outputs\\nof other elements|much like networks of biological neurons do. These networks\\ncommonly use the threshold element which we encountered in chapter two in\\nour study of linearly separable Boolean functions. We begin our treatment of\\nneural nets by studying this threshold element and how it can be used in the\\nsimplest of all networks, namely ones composed of a single threshold element.\\n4.1 Threshold Logic Units\\n4.1.1 De\\x0cnitions and Geometry\\nLinearly separable (threshold) functions are implemented in a straightforward\\nway by summing the weighted inputs and comparing this sum to a threshold\\nvalue as shown in Fig. 4.1.

The\\nweighted sum that is calculated by the TLU can be simply represented as a\\nvector dot product, X\\x0fW.

Weight points\\nin one of the half-spaces de\\x0cned by this hyperplane will cause the corresponding\\npattern to yield a dot product less than 0, and weight points in the other half-\\nspace will cause the corresponding pattern to yield a dot product greater than\\n0.\\nWe show a schematic representation of such a weight space in Fig. 4.5.\\nThere are four pattern hyperplanes, 1, 2, 3, 4 , corresponding to patterns Y1,', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

Typically, the error-correction procedures will not do well on non-\\nlinearly-separable training sets because they will continue to attempt to correct\\ninevitable errors, and the hyperplane will never settle into an acceptable place.\\nSeveral methods have been proposed to deal with this case. First, we might\\nuse the Widrow-Ho\\x0b procedure, which (although it will not converge to zero\\nerror on non-linearly separable problems) will give us a weight vector that min-\\nimizes the mean-squared-error. A mean-squared-error criterion often gives un-\\nsatisfactory results, however, because it prefers many small errors to a few large\\nones. As an alternative, error correction with a continuous decrease toward zero\\nof the value of the learning rate constant, c, will result in ever decreasing changes\\nto the hyperplane. Duda [Duda, 1966] has suggested keeping track of the average\\nvalue of the weight vector during error correction and using this average to give a\\nseparating hyperplane that performs reasonably well on non-linearly-separable\\nproblems. Gallant [Gallant, 1986] proposed what he called the \\\\pocket algo-\\nrithm.\" As described in [Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991, p. 160]:\\n. . . the pocket algorithm . . . consists simply in storing (or \\\\putting\\nin your pocket\") the set of weights which has had the longest un-\\nmodi\\x0ced run of successes so far. The algorithm is stopped after some\\nchosen time t. . .\\nAfter stopping, the weights in the pocket are used as a set that should give a\\nsmall number of errors on the training set. Error-correction proceeds as usual\\nwith the ordinary set of weights. Also see methods proposed by\\n[John, 1995] and by\\n[Marchand & Golea, 1993].

No single line through the\\n2-dimensional square can separate the vertices (1,1) and (0,0) from the vertices\\n(1,0) and (0,1)|the function is not linearly separable and thus cannot be im-\\nplemented by a single TLU.

In the \\x0cgure, we show the weight values along\\ninput lines to each TLU and the threshold value inside the circle representing\\nthe TLU.\\nThe function implemented by a network of TLUs depends on its topology\\nas well as on the weights of the individual TLUs. Feedforward networks have\\nno cycles; in a feedforward network no TLU's input depends (through zero\\nor more intermediate TLUs) on that TLU's output.

Consider, for\\nexample, the layered, feedforward network of Fig. 4.11. If such a network makes\\nan error on a pattern, there are usually several di\\x0berent ways in which the error\\ncan be corrected. It is di\\x0ecult to assign \\\\blame\" for the error to any particular\\nTLU in the network. Intuitively, one looks for weight-adjusting procedures that\\nmove the network in the correct direction (relative to the error) by making\\nminimal changes. In this spirit, the Widrow-Ho\\x0b method of gradient descent\\nhas been generalized to deal with multilayer networks.\\nIn explaining this generalization, we use Fig. 4.17 to introduce some nota-\\ntion. This network has only one output unit, but, of course, it is possible to have\\nseveral TLUs in the output layer|each implementing a di\\x0berent function. Each\\nof the layers of TLUs will have outputs that we take to be the components of\\nvectors, just as the input features are components of an input vector. The j-th\\nlayer of TLUs (1\\x14j <k ) will have as their outputs the vector X(j). The input\\nfeature vector is denoted by X(0), and the \\x0cnal output (of the k-th layer TLU)\\nisf. Each TLU in each layer has a weight vector (connecting it to its inputs)\\nand a threshold; the i-th TLU in the j-th layer has a weight vector denoted by\\nW(j)\\ni.

The network is trained incrementally by backprop to\\nproduce the driver-speci\\x0ced steering angles in response to each visual pattern\\nas it occurs in real time while driving.\\nThis simple procedure has been augmented to avoid two potential problems.\\nFirst, since the driver is usually driving well, the network would never get any\\nexperience with far-from-center vehicle positions and/or incorrect vehicle orien-\\ntations. Also, on long, straight stretches of road, the network would be trained\\nfor a long time only to produce straight-ahead steering angles; this training\\nwould swamp out earlier training to follow a curved road. We wouldn't want\\nto try to avoid these problems by instructing the driver to drive erratically\\noccasionally, because the system would learn to mimic this erratic behavior.\\nInstead, each original image is shifted and rotated in software to create 14\\nadditional images in which the vehicle appears to be situated di\\x0berently relative\\nto the road. Using a model that tells the system what steering angle ought to\\nbe used for each of these shifted images, given the driver-speci\\x0ced steering angle\\nfor the original image, the system constructs an additional 14 labeled training\\npatterns to add to those encountered during ordinary driver training.\\n4.5 Synergies Between Neural Network and\\nKnowledge-Based Methods\\nTo be written; discuss\\nrule-generating procedures (such as\\n[Towell & Shavlik, 1992]) and how\\nexpert-provided rules can aid\\nneural net training and vice-versa\\n[Towell, Shavlik, & Noordweier, 1990].4.6 Bibliographical and Historical Remarks\\nTo be added.\", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

In\\nprinciple, given a set of labeled patterns, we can measure the uncertainty reduc-\\ntion for each test that is achieved by every possible threshold (there are only\\na \\x0cnite number of thresholds that give di\\x0berent test results if there are only\\na \\x0cnite number of training patterns). Similarly, if an attribute is categorical\\n(with a \\x0cnite number of categories), there are only a \\x0cnite number of mutually\\nexclusive and exhaustive subsets into which the values of the attribute can be\\nsplit. We can calculate the uncertainty reduction for each split.\\n6.3 Networks Equivalent to Decision Trees\\nSince univariate Boolean decision trees are implementations of DNF functions,\\nthey are also equivalent to two-layer, feedforward neural networks.

When there are too many hypotheses that are consistent with the training\\nset, we say that we are over\\x0ctting the training data. Over\\x0ctting is a problem\\nthat we must address for all learning methods.\\nSince a decision tree of su\\x0ecient size can implement anyBoolean function\\nthere is a danger of over\\x0ctting|especially if the training set is small. That\\nis, even if the decision tree is synthesized to classify all the members of the\\ntraining set correctly, it might perform poorly on new patterns that were not\\nused to build the decision tree. Several techniques have been proposed to avoid\\nover\\x0ctting, and we shall examine some of them here. They make use of methods\\nfor estimating how well a given decision tree might generalize|methods we shall\\ndescribe next.\\n6.4.2 Validation Methods\\nThe most straightforward way to estimate how well a hypothesized function\\n(such as a decision tree) performs on a test set is to test it on the test set!

But splitting reduces the size of the\\ntraining set and thereby increases the possibility of over\\x0ctting. We next describe\\nsome validation techniques that attempt to avoid these problems.\\nCross-Validation\\nIncross-validation , we divide the training set \\x04 into Kmutually exclusive and\\nexhaustive equal-sized subsets: \\x04 1;:::; \\x04K. For each subset, \\x04 i, train on the\\nunion of all of the other subsets, and empirically determine the error rate, \"i,\\non \\x04i. (The error rate is the number of classi\\x0ccation errors made on \\x04 idivided\\nby the number of patterns in \\x04 i.) An estimate of the error rate that can be\\nexpected on new patterns of a classi\\x0cer trained on allthe patterns in \\x04 is then\\nthe average of the \"i.\\nLeave-one-out Validation\\nLeave-one-out validation is the same as cross validation for the special case in\\nwhichKequals the number of patterns in \\x04, and each \\x04 iconsists of a single\\npattern. When testing on each \\x04 i, we simply note whether or not a mistake\\nwas made. We count the total number of mistakes and divide by Kto get\\nthe estimated error rate. This type of validation is, of course, more expensive\\ncomputationally, but useful when a more accurate estimate of the error rate for\\na classi\\x0cer is needed. Describe \\\\bootstrapping\" also\\n[Efron, 1982].\\n6.4.3 Avoiding Over\\x0ctting in Decision Trees\\nNear the tips of a decision tree there may be only a few patterns per node.\\nFor these nodes, we are selecting a test based on a very small sample, and thus\\nwe are likely to be over\\x0ctting. This problem can be dealt with by terminating\\nthe test-generating procedure before all patterns are perfectly split into their\\nseparate categories. That is, a leaf node may contain patterns of more than one\\nclass, but we can decide in favor of the most numerous class. This procedure\\nwill result in a few errors but often accepting a small number of errors on the\\ntraining set results in fewer errors on a testing set.\\nThis behavior is illustrated in Fig. 6.8.\\nOne can use cross-validation techniques to determine when to stop splitting\\nnodes. If the cross validation error increases as a consequence of a node split,\\nthen don\\'t split. One has to be careful about when to stop, though, because\\nunder\\x0ctting usually leads to more errors on test sets than does over\\x0ctting. There\\nis a general rule that the lowest error-rate attainable by a sub-tree of a fully\\nexpanded tree can be no less than 1/2 of the error rate of the fully expanded\\ntree [Weiss & Kulikowski, 1991, page 126].', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

This technique is called post-pruning .\\nVarious techniques for pruning are discussed in [Weiss & Kulikowski, 1991].\\n6.4.4 Minimum-Description Length Methods\\nAn important tree-growing and pruning technique is based on the minimum-\\ndescription-length (MDL) principle. (MDL is an important idea that extends\\nbeyond decision-tree methods [Rissanen, 1978].) The idea is that the simplest\\ndecision tree that can predict the classes of the training patterns is the best\\none. Consider the problem of transmitting just the labels of a training set of\\npatterns, assuming that the receiver of this information already has the ordered\\nset of patterns. If there are mpatterns, each labeled by one of Rclasses,\\none could transmit a list of m R-valued numbers. Assuming equally probable\\nclasses, this transmission would require mlog2Rbits. Or, one could transmit a\\ndecision tree that correctly labelled all of the patterns. The number of bits that\\nthis transmission would require depends on the technique for encoding decision\\ntrees and on the size of the tree. If the tree is small and accurately classi\\x0ces\\nall of the patterns, it might be more economical to transmit the tree than to\\ntransmit the labels directly. In between these extremes, we might transmit a\\ntree plus a list of labels of all the patterns that the tree misclassi\\x0ces.\\nIn general, the number of bits (or description length of the binary encoded\\nmessage) is t+d, wheretis the length of the message required to transmit\\nthe tree, and dis the length of the message required to transmit the labels of', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='84 CHAPTER 6. DECISION TREES\\nthe patterns misclassi\\x0ced by the tree. In a sense, that tree associated with the\\nsmallest value of t+dis the best or most economical tree. The MDL method\\nis one way of adhering to the Occam\\'s razor principle.\\nQuinlan and Rivest [Quinlan & Rivest, 1989] have proposed techniques for\\nencoding decision trees and lists of exception labels and for calculating the\\ndescription length ( t+d) of these trees and labels. They then use the description\\nlength as a measure of quality of a tree in two ways:\\na. In growing a tree, they use the reduction in description length to select\\ntests (instead of reduction in uncertainty).\\nb. In pruning a tree after it has been grown to zero error, they prune away\\nthose nodes (starting at the tips) that achieve a decrease in the description\\nlength.\\nThese techniques compare favorably with the uncertainty-reduction method,\\nalthough they are quite sensitive to the coding schemes used.\\n6.4.5 Noise in Data\\nNoise in the data means that one must inevitably accept some number of\\nerrors|depending on the noise level. Refusal to tolerate errors on the training\\nset when there is noise leads to the problem of \\\\\\x0ctting the noise.\" Dealing with\\nnoise, then, requires accepting some errors at the leaf nodes just as does the\\nfact that there are a small number of patterns at leaf nodes.\\n6.5 The Problem of Replicated Subtrees\\nDecision trees are not the most economical means of implementing some Boolean\\nfunctions. Consider, for example, the function f=x1x2+x3x4. A decision tree\\nfor this function is shown in Fig. 6.9. Notice the replicated subtrees shown\\ncircled. The DNF-form equivalent to the function implemented by this decision\\ntree isf=x1x2+x1x2x3x4+x1x3x4. This DNF form is non-minimal (in the\\nnumber of disjunctions) and is equivalent to f=x1x2+x3x4.\\nThe need for replication means that it takes longer to learn the tree and\\nthat subtrees replicated further down the tree must be learned using a smaller\\ntraining subset. This problem is sometimes called the fragmentation problem .\\nSeveral approaches might be suggested for dealing with fragmenta-\\ntion. One is to attempt to build a decision graph instead of a tree\\n[Oliver, Dowe, & Wallace, 1992, Kohavi, 1994]. A decision graph that imple-\\nments the same decisions as that of the decision tree of Fig. 6.9 is shown in Fig.\\n6.10.\\nAnother approach is to use multivariate (rather than univariate tests at each\\nnode).

We are given a training set\\nconsisting of positive and negative examples. As positive examples, we might\\nhave (A,B) ,(A, A1) , and some other pairs; as negative examples, we might\\nhave (A1, A2) , and some other pairs.

A special case, which is what\\nwe use here, is that a clause c1is more special than a clause c2if the set of\\nliterals in the body of c2is a subset of those in c1. This ordering relation can\\nbe used in a structure of partially ordered clauses, called the re\\x0cnement graph ,\\nthat is similar to a version space. Clause c1is an immediate successor of clause\\nc2in this graph if and only if clause c1can be obtained from clause c2by adding\\na literal to the body of c2. A re\\x0cnement graph then tells us the ways in which\\nwe can specialize a clause by adding a literal to it.\\nOf course there are unlimited possible literals we might add to the body of\\na clause. Practical ILP systems restrict the literals in various ways. Typical\\nallowed additions are:\\na. Literals used in the background knowledge.\\nb. Literals whose arguments are a subset of those in the head of the clause.\\nc. Literals that introduce a new distinct variable di\\x0berent from those in the\\nhead of the clause.\\nd. A literal that equates a variable in the head of the clause with another\\nsuch variable or with a term mentioned in the background knowledge.\\n(This possibility is equivalent to forming a specialization by making a\\nsubstitution.)', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

A\\nmajor problem involves deciding how to select a literal to add in the inner loop\\n(from among the literals that are allowed). In FOIL, Quinlan suggested that\\ncandidate literals can be compared using an information-like measure|similar\\nto the measures used in inducing decision trees. A measure that gives the same\\ncomparison as does Quinlan\\'s is based on the amount by which adding a literal\\nincreases the odds that an instance drawn at random from those covered by the\\nnew clause is a positive instance beyond what these odds were before adding\\nthe literal.\\nLetpbe an estimate of the probability that an instance drawn at random\\nfrom those covered by a clause before adding the literal is a positive instance.\\nThat is,p=(number of positive instances covered by the clause)/(total number\\nof instances covered by the clause). It is convenient to express this probability\\nin \\\\odds form.\" The odds, o, that a covered instance is positive is de\\x0cned to\\nbeo=p=(1\\x00p).

       " Document(page_content=\"7.6. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ILP AND DECISION TREE INDUCTION 101\\nAfter selecting a literal, l, to add to a clause, some of the instances previously\\ncovered are still covered; some of these are positive and some are negative. Let\\npldenote the probability that an instance drawn at random from the instances\\ncovered by the new clause (with ladded) is positive. The odds will be denoted\\nbyol. We want to select a literal, l, that gives maximal increase in these\\nodds. That is, if we de\\x0cne \\x15l=ol=o, we want a literal that gives a high\\nvalue of\\x15l. Specializing the clause in such a way that it fails to cover many of\\nthe negative instances previously covered but still covers most of the positive\\ninstances previously covered will result in a high value of \\x15l. (It turns out that\\nthe value of Quinlan's information theoretic measure increases monotonically\\nwith\\x15l, so we could just as well use the latter instead.)\\nBesides \\x0cnding a literal with a high value of \\x15l, Quinlan's FOIL system also\\nrestricts the choice to literals that:\\na) contain at least one variable that has already been used,\\nb) place further restrictions on the variables if the literal selected has the\\nsame predicate letter as the literal being induced (in order to prevent in\\x0cnite\\nrecursion), and\\nc) survive a pruning test based on the values of \\x15lfor those literals selected\\nso far.\\nWe refer the reader to Quinlan's paper for further discussion of these points.\\nQuinlan also discusses post-processing pruning methods and presents experi-\\nmental results of the method applied to learning recursive relations on lists, on\\nlearning rules for chess endgames and for the card game Eleusis, and for some\\nother standard tasks mentioned in the machine learning literature.\\nThe reader should also refer to [Pazzani & Kibler, 1992,\\nLavra\\x14 c & D\\x14 zeroski, 1994, Muggleton, 1991, Muggleton, 1992].

Recall the problem of inducing decision trees when the values of\\nattributes are categorical. When splitting on a single variable, the split at\\neach node involves asking to which of several mutually exclusive and exhaustive\\nsubsets the value of a variable belongs. For example, if a node tested the variable\\nxi, and ifxicould have values drawn from fA;B;C;D;E;Fg, then one possible\\nsplit (among many) might be according to whether the value of xihad as value\\none offA;B;Cgor one offD;E;Fg.\\nIt is also possible to make a multi-variate split|testing the values of two or\\nmore variables at a time. With categorical variables, an n-variable split would\\nbe based on which of several n-ary relations the values of the variables satis\\x0ced.\\nFor example, if a node tested the variables xiandxj, and ifxiandxjboth\\ncould have values drawn from fA;B;C;D;E;Fg, then one possible binary split\", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",

(Note that our subset method of forming single-\\nvariable splits could equivalently have been framed using 1-ary relations|which\\nare usually called properties.)\\nIn this framework, the ILP problem is as follows: We are given a training set,\\n\\x04, of positively and negatively labeled patterns whose components are drawn\\nfrom a set of variables fx;y;z;:::g. The positively labeled patterns in \\x04 form an\\nextensional de\\x0cnition of a relation, R. We are also given background relations,\\nR1;:::;Rk, on various subsets of these variables. (That is, we are given sets\\nof tuples that are in these relations.) We desire to construct an intensional\\nde\\x0cnition of Rin terms of the R1;:::;Rk, such that all of the positively labeled\\npatterns in \\x04 are satis\\x0ced by Rand none of the negatively labeled patterns\\nare. The intensional de\\x0cnition will be in terms of a logic program in which the\\nrelationRis the head of a set of clauses whose bodies involve the background\\nrelations.\\nThe generic ILP algorithm can be understood as decision tree induction,\\nwhere each node of the decision tree is itself a sub-decision tree, and each sub-\\ndecision tree consists of nodes that make binary splits on several variables using\\nthe background relations, Ri. Thus we will speak of a top-level decision tree\\nand various sub-decision trees. (Actually, our decision trees will be decision\\nlists|a special case of decision trees, but we will refer to them as trees in our\\ndiscussions.)\\nIn broad outline, the method for inducing an intensional version of the rela-\\ntionRis illustrated by considering the decision tree shown in Fig. 7.5. In this\\ndiagram, the patterns in \\x04 are \\x0crst \\x0cltered through the decision tree in top-\\nlevel node 1. The background relation R1is satis\\x0ced by some of these patterns;\\nthese are \\x0cltered to the right (to relation R2), and the rest are \\x0cltered to the\\nleft (more on what happens to these later). Right-going patterns are \\x0cltered\\nthrough a sequence of relational tests until only positively labeled patterns sat-\\nisfy the last relation|in this case R3. That is, the subset of patterns satisfying\\nall the relations, R1,R2, andR3contains only positive instances from \\x04. (We\\nmight say that this combination of tests is necessary. They correspond to the\\nclause created in the \\x0crst pass through the inner loop of the generic ILP algo-\\nrithm.) Let us call the subset of patterns satisfying these relations, \\x04 1; these\\nsatisfy Node 1 at the top level.

We continue\\n\\x0cltering through top-level nodes until only the negatively labeled patterns fail to\\nsatisfy a top node. In our example, \\x04 4contains only negatively labeled patterns\\nand the union of \\x04 1and \\x04 3contains all the positively labeled patterns.

We gave some intuitive arguments to support\\nthe claim that after seeing only a small fraction of the possible inputs (and\\ntheir values) that we could guess almost correctly the values of most subsequent\\ninputs|if we knew that the function we were trying to guess belonged to an\\nappropriately restricted subset of functions. That is, a given training set of\\nsample patterns might be adequate to allow us to select a function, consistent\\nwith the labeled samples , from among a restricted set of hypotheses such that\\nwith high probability the function we select will be approximately correct (small\\nprobability of error) on subsequent samples drawn at random according to the\\nsame distribution from which the labeled samples were drawn. This insight\\nled to the theory of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning|initially\\ndeveloped by Leslie Valiant [Valiant, 1984]. We present here a brief description\\nof the theory for the case of Boolean functions. [Dietterich, 1990, Haussler, 1988,\\nHaussler, 1990] give nice surveys of the important results.

Along with\\nits sensory inputs are \\\\rewards,\" which it occasionally receives. How should it\\nchoose its actions so as to maximize its rewards over the long run? To maximize\\nrewards, it will need to be able to predict how actions change inputs, and in\\nparticular, how actions lead to rewards.\\nWe formalize the problem in the following way: The robot exists in an\\nenvironment consisting of a set, S, of states. We assume that the robot\\'s sensory\\napparatus constructs an input vector, X, from the environment, which informs\\nthe robot about which state the environment is in. For the moment, we will\\nassume that the mapping from states to vectors is one-to-one, and, in fact, will\\nuse the notation Xto refer to the state of the environment as well as to the\\ninput vector. When presented with an input vector, the robot decides which\\naction from a set, A, of actions to perform. Performing the action produces an\\ne\\x0bect on the environment|moving it to a new state. The new state results in\\nthe robot perceiving a new input vector, and the cycle repeats. We assume a\\ndiscrete time model; the input vector at time t=iisXi, the action taken at\\nthat time is ai, and the expected reward, ri, received at t=idepends on the\\naction taken and on the state, that is ri=r(Xi;ai). The learner\\'s goal is to \\x0cnd\\napolicy ,\\x19(X), that maps input vectors to actions in such a way that maximizes\\nrewards accumulated over time. This type of learning is called reinforcement\\nlearning . The learner must \\x0cnd the policy by trial and error; it has no initial\\nknowledge of the e\\x0bects of its actions.

The maximum\\nQvalue in cell (1,3) is 5, and the learning mechanism attempts to make the\\nvalue ofQ((2;3);w) closer to the discounted value of 5 plus the immediate\\nreward (which was 0 in this case). With a learning rate parameter c= 0:5\\nand\\r= 0:9, theQvalue ofQ((2;3);w) is adjusted from 7 to 5.75. No other\\nchanges are made to the table at this episode. The reader might try this learning\\nprocedure on the grid world with a simple computer program. Notice that an\\noptimal policy might not be discovered if some cells are not visited nor some\\nactions not tried frequently enough.\\nThe learning problem faced by the agent is to associate speci\\x0cc actions with\\nspeci\\x0cc input patterns. Qlearning gradually reinforces those actions that con-\\ntribute to positive rewards by increasing the associated Qvalues. Typically, as\\nin this example, rewards occur somewhat after the actions that lead to them|\\nhence the phrase delayed-reinforcement learning. One can imagine that better\\nand better approximations to the optimal Qvalues gradually propagate back\\nfrom states producing rewards toward all of the other states that the agent fre-\\nquently visits. With random Qvalues to begin, the agent's actions amount to a\\nrandom walk through its space of states. Only when this random walk happens\\nto stumble into rewarding states does Qlearning begin to produce Qvalues\\nthat are useful, and, even then, the Qvalues have to work their way outward\\nfrom these rewarding states. The general problem of associating rewards with\\nstate-action pairs is called the temporal credit assignment problem |how should\\ncredit for a reward be apportioned to the actions leading up to it?

Instead of\\nrepresenting a goal as a condition to be achieved, we represent a \\\\goal struc-\\nture\" as a set of rewards to be given for achieving various conditions. Then,\\nthe generalized \\\\goal\" becomes maximizing discounted future reward instead of\\nsimply achieving some particular condition. This generalization can be made to\\nencompass so-called goals of maintenance and goals of avoidance . The exam-\\nple presented above included avoiding bumping into the grid-world boundary.\\nA goal of maintenance, of a particular state, could be expressed in terms of a\\nreward that was earned whenever the agent was in that state and performed an\\naction that transitioned back to that state in one step.\\n11.5.2 Using Random Actions\\nWhen the next pattern presentation in a sequence of patterns is the one caused\\nby the agent\\'s own action in response to the last pattern, we have what is called\\nanon-line learning method. In Watkins and Dayan\\'s terminology, in on-line\\nlearning the episodes form a continous sequence. As already mentioned, the\\nconvergence theorem for Qlearning does not require on-line learning; indeed,\\nspecial precautions must be taken to ensure that on-line learning meets the\\nconditions of the theorem. If on-line learning discovers some good paths to\\nrewards, the agent may \\x0cxate on these and never discover a policy that leads\\nto a possibly greater long-term reward. In reinforcement learning phraseology,\\nthis problem is referred to as the problem of exploitation (of already learned\\nbehavior) versus exploration (of possibly better behavior).\\nOne way to force exploration is to perform occasional random actions (in-\\nstead of that single action prescribed by the current Qvalues). For example,\\nin the grid-world problem, one could imagine selecting an action randomly ac-\\ncording to a probability distribution over the actions ( n;e;s; andw). This\\ndistribution, in turn, could depend on the Qvalues. For example, we might\\n\\x0crst \\x0cnd that action prescribed by the Qvalues and then choose that action\\nwith probability 1/2, choose the two orthogonal actions with probability 3/16\\neach, and choose the opposite action with probability 1/8. This policy might be\\nmodi\\x0ced by \\\\simulated annealing\" which would gradually increase the probabil-\\nity of the action prescribed by the Qvalues more and more as time goes on. This\\nstrategy would favor exploration at the beginning of learning and exploitation\\nlater.\\nOther methods, also, have been proposed for dealing with exploration, in-\\ncluding making unvisited states intrinsically rewarding and using an \\\\interval\\nestimate,\" which is related to the uncertainty in the estimate of a state\\'s value\\n[Kaelbling, 1993].', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 160}),\n",

TheQvalues (as a function of the input pattern Xand the action ai) are\\ncomputed as dot products of weight vectors (one for each action) and the input\\nvector. Weight adjustments are made according to a TD(0) procedure to bring\\ntheQvalue for the action last selected closer to the sum of the immediate reward\\n(if any) and the (discounted) maximum Qvalue for the next input pattern.\\nIf the optimum Qvalues for the problem (whatever they might be) are more\\ncomplex than those that can be computed by a linear machine, a layered neural\\nnetwork might be used. Sigmoid units in the \\x0cnal layer would compute Qvalues\\nin the range 0 to 1. The TD(0) method for updating Qvalues would then have to\\nbe combined with a multi-layer weight-changing rule, such as backpropagation.\\nNetworks of this sort are able to aggregate di\\x0berent input vectors into regions\\nfor which the same action should be performed.

Several researchers have attempted to deal with\\nthis problem using a variety of methods including attempting to model \\\\hid-\\nden\" states by using internal memory [Lin, 1993].

We want to \\x0cnd a way to classify robots as \\\\robust\" or not. The attributes\\nthat we use to represent a robot might include some that are relevant to this\\ndecision and some that are not.', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='160 CHAPTER 12. EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING\\nSuppose we have a domain theory of logical sentences that taken together,\\nhelp to de\\x0cne whether or not a robot can be classi\\x0ced as robust. (The same\\ndomain theory may be useful for several other purposes also, but among other\\nthings, it describes the concept \\\\robust.\")\\nIn this example, let\\'s suppose that our domain theory includes the sentences:\\nFixes (u;u)\\x1bRobust (u)\\n(An individual that can \\x0cx itself is robust.)\\nSees(x;y)^Habile (x)\\x1bFixes (x;y)\\n(A habile individual that can see another entity can \\x0cx that entity.)\\nRobot (w)\\x1bSees(w;w)\\n(All robots can see themselves.)\\nR2D2(x)\\x1bHabile (x)\\n(R2D2-class individuals are habile.)\\nC3PO(x)\\x1bHabile (x)\\n(C3PO-class individuals are habile.)\\n:::\\n(By convention, variables are assumed to be universally quanti\\x0ced.) We could\\nuse theorem-proving methods operating on this domain theory to conclude\\nwhether certain robots are robust. These methods might be computationally\\nquite expensive because extensive search may have to be performed to derive a\\nconclusion. But after having found a proof for some particular robot, we might\\nbe able to derive some new sentence whose use allows a much faster conclusion.\\nWe next show how such a new rule might be derived in this example. Suppose\\nwe are given a number of facts about Num5, such as:\\nRobot (Num 5)\\nR2D2(Num 5)\\nAge(Num 5;5)\\nManufacturer (Num 5;GR)\\n:::', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",

The facts about Num5 correspond to the features that we might use\\nto represent Num5. In this example, not all of them are relevant to a decision\\naboutRobust (Num 5). The relevant ones are those used or needed in proving\\nRobust (Num 5) using the domain theory. The proof tree in Fig. 12.2 is one that\\na typical theorem-proving system might produce.\\nIn the language of EBL, this proof is an explanation for the fact\\nRobust (Num 5). We see from this explanation that the only facts about Num5\\nthat were used were Robot (Num 5) andR2D2(Num 5). In fact, we could con-\\nstruct the following rule from this explanation:\\nRobot (Num 5)^R2D2(Num 5)\\x1bRobust (Num 5)\\nThe explanation has allowed us to prune some attributes about Num5 that are\\nirrelevant (at least for deciding Robust (Num 5)). This type of pruning is the \\x0crst\\nsense in which an explanation is used to generalize the classi\\x0ccation problem.\\n([DeJong & Mooney, 1986] call this aspect of explanation-based learning feature\\nelimination .) But the rule we extracted from the explanation applies only to\\nNum5. There might be little value in learning that rule since it is so speci\\x0cc.\\nCan it be generalized so that it can be applied to other individuals as well?', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 169}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"162 CHAPTER 12. EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING\\nExamination of the proof shows that the same proof structure, using the\\nsame sentences from the domain theory, could be used independently of whether\\nwe are talking about Num5 or some other individual. We can generalize the\\nproof by a process that replaces constants in the tip nodes of the proof tree\\nwith variables and works upward|using uni\\x0ccation to constrain the values of\\nvariables as needed to obtain a proof.\\nIn this example, we replace Robot (Num 5) byRobot (r) andR2D2(Num 5)\\nbyR2D2(s) and redo the proof|using the explanation proof as a template.\\nNote that we use di\\x0berent values for the two di\\x0berent occurrences of Num 5 at\\nthe tip nodes. Doing so sometimes results in more general, but nevertheless\\nvalid rules. We now apply the rules used in the proof in the forward direction,\\nkeeping track of the substitutions imposed by the most general uni\\x0cers used in\\nthe proof. (Note that we always substitute terms that are already in the tree for\\nvariables in rules.) This process results in the generalized proof tree shown in\\nFig. 12.3. Note that the occurrence of Sees(r;r) as a node in the tree forces the\\nuni\\x0ccation of xwithyin the domain rule, Sees(x;y)^Habile (y)\\x1bFixes (x;y).\\nThe substitutions are then applied to the variables in the tip nodes and the root\\nnode to yield the general rule: Robot (r)^R2D2(r)\\x1bRobust (r).\\nThis rule is the end result of EBL for this example. The process\\nby which Num 5 in this example was generalized to a variable is what\\n[DeJong & Mooney, 1986] call identity elimination (the precise identity of Num5\\nturned out to be irrelevant). (The generalization process described in this ex-\\nample is based on that of [DeJong & Mooney, 1986] and di\\x0bers from that of\\n[Mitchell, et al. , 1986]. It is also similar to that used in [Fikes, et al. , 1972].)\\nClearly, under certain assumptions, this general rule is more easily used to con-\\ncludeRobust about an individual than the original proof process was.\\nIt is important to note that we could have derived the general rule from the\\ndomain theory without using the example. (In the literature, doing so is called\\nstatic analysis [Etzioni, 1991].) In fact, the example told us nothing new other\\nthan what it told us about Num5. The sole role of the example in this instance\\nof EBL was to provide a template for a proof to help guide the generalization\\nprocess. Basing the generalization process on examples helps to insure that we\\nlearn rules matched to the distribution of problems that occur.\\nThere are a number of quali\\x0ccations and elaborations about EBL that need\\nto be mentioned.\\n12.4 Evaluable Predicates\\nThe domain theory includes a number of predicates other than the one occuring\\nin the formula we are trying to prove and other than those that might custom-\\narily be used to describe an individual. One might note, for example, that if we\\nusedHabile (Num 5) to describe Num5, the proof would have been shorter. Why\\ndidn't we? The situation is analogous to that of using a data base augmented\\nby logical rules.

       " Document(page_content='164 CHAPTER 12. EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING\\n12.5 More General Proofs\\nExamining the domain theory for our example reveals that an alternative rule\\nmight have been: Robot (u)^C3PO(u)\\x1bRobust (u). Such a rule might\\nhave resulted if we were given fC3PO(Num 6);Robot (Num 6);:::gand proved\\nRobust (Num 6). After considering these two examples (Num5 and Num6),\\nthe question arises, do we want to generalize the two rules to something like:\\nRobot (u)^[C3PO(u)_R2D2(u)]\\x1bRobust (u)? Doing so is an example of what\\n[DeJong & Mooney, 1986] call structural generalization (via disjunctive augmen-\\ntation ).\\nAdding disjunctions for every alternative proof can soon become cumbersome\\nand destroy any e\\x0eciency advantage of EBL. In our example, the e\\x0eciency\\nmight be retrieved if there were another evaluable predicate, say, Bionic (u) such\\nthat the domain theory also contained R2D2(x)\\x1bBionic (x) andC3PO(x)\\x1b\\nBionic (x). After seeing a number of similar examples, we might be willing to\\ninduce the formula Bionic (u)\\x1b[C3PO(u)_R2D2(u)] in which case the rule\\nwith the disjunction could be replaced with Robot (u)^Bionic (u)\\x1bRobust (u).\\n12.6 Utility of EBL\\nIt is well known in theorem proving that the complexity of \\x0cnding a proof\\ndepends both on the number of formulas in the domain theory and on the depth\\nof the shortest proof. Adding a new rule decreases the depth of the shortest\\nproof but it also increases the number of formulas in the domain theory. In\\nrealistic applications, the added rules will be relevant for some tasks and not for\\nothers. Thus, it is unclear whether the overall utility of the new rules will turn\\nout to be positive. EBL methods have been applied in several settings, usually\\nwith positive utility. (See [Minton, 1990] for an analysis).\\n12.7 Applications\\nThere have been several applications of EBL methods. We mention two here,\\nnamely the formation of macro-operators in automatic plan generation and\\nlearning how to control search.\\n12.7.1 Macro-Operators in Planning\\nIn automatic planning systems, e\\x0eciency can sometimes be enhanced by chain-\\ning together a sequence of operators into macro-operators . We show an exam-\\nple of a process for creating macro-operators based on techniques explored by\\n[Fikes, et al. , 1972].\\nReferring to Fig. 12.4, consider the problem of \\x0cnding a plan for a robot in\\nroomR1 to fetch a box, B1, by going to an adjacent room, R2, and pushing it', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pdf1.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",
